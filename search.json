    "text": "Above, we can see a striking graph comparing three beautiful penguins: The Adelie, the Chinstrap, and the Gentoo penguins. By creating three different shaped and colored dots, we can compare each type of penguin very easily by just looking at the graph. The yellow circles represent Adelie penguins, the purple triangles represent Chinstrap penguins, and the blue squares represent Gentoo penguins. With the x-axis representing the penguins’ Flipper lengths in millimeters and the y-axis represenfing the penguins’ Bill Lengths in millimeters, we can very easily see that the majority of penguins, regardless of the type, have quite proportional flipper:bill lengths. However, we can also observe that Gentoos have much longer flipper lengths than either of the other species."
